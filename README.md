# My-GitHub-Commits

I noticed that some of my commits were disappearing from the GitHub contribution graph over time. After trying to fix it and failing many times, I decided to document my commits myself.

So, I created this repository to manually track my commits. My plan is simple:
Every time I am done making a commit on any of my projects, I’ll take a screenshot of the commit and upload it here.

This way, I’ll always have a visual log of my activity, even if GitHub doesn’t reflect it accurately.
